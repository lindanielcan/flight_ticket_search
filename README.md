# flight_ticket_search<br />
a program that searches cheap fight tickets for users.<br />
the program is not finished, in order to use the program, the user will need to obtain a few api end point and api keys.
The ultimate goal of this project is creating a GUI for the user to sign up or sign in, the user's account info would be stored into my google sheet, however, my sheety account access (an api used to interact with google sheets) is not working because i was using the free version and it only allowed me to get a very limited number of requests.
The following api's are needed to make the program functioning:<br />
  a. api from https://sheety.co/ which was used to interact data from your google sheet account.<br />
  b. two api from tequila.kiwi.com was needed, one was for converting city name into airport IATA Code and the other api is need to search for the ticket info.<br />
  c. you will also need to get an api from https://www.twilio.com/docs, so you can get text message notifications sent to your phone.<br />

You may see the demonstrations from the two photos.
